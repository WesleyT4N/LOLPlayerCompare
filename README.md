# LOLPlayerCompare
League Project Site which will simply compare stats of players to see who is better.

Built using: HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Riot API, PHP, and Bootstrap

# Status
This project is on indefinite hiatus until I get some time to replace the backend with Python and remove JQuery dependency. (Also need to migrate to Riot's new API)
